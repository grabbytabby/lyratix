            The Stem Player is an audio remix device and music streaming platform developed by  
            British technology company Kano Computing in collaboration with American artist Kanye West. 
            The device was launched in August 2021 in conjunction with the release of West's 10th studio album Donda.[1]

The Stem Player allows users to create and listen to unique remixes of audio tracks in real time using four touch-sensitive haptic sliders that adjust individual stems, and six hardware buttons for volume and effects. The device's service, using artificial intelligence developed by Kano,[2] splits tracks into four stems (sometimes      isolated vocals, bass, and drums) with each track being able to be manipulated using a front slider.[3] Users can add tracks to the device by uploading an audio file to           the device through an official online web application
